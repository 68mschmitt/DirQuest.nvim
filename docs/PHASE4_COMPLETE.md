- [x] Directory names embedded in structures
- [x] Ground line renders correctly
- [x] Multiple directories positioned horizontally
- [x] Files appear as simple sprites
- [x] World can be wider than screen
- [x] Player can navigate through world

### Key Improvements Over Phase 3

- **Visual Structures** - Directories now appear as ASCII art buildings
- **Size Awareness** - Different art for different directory sizes
- **Ground System** - Visual floor that anchors the world
- **File Visibility** - Files shown as distinct sprites with types
- **Spatial Layout** - Horizontal arrangement creates exploration space
- **Object System** - Foundation for collision and interaction
- **Collision System** - Coordinate-based rectangle collision detection
- **Clean Architecture** - Visual grid separate from collision logic

### Directory Art Templates

**Small** (< 5 items):
```
  ___  
 |   | 
 |   | 
 |___| 
```

**Medium** (5-15 items):
```
   _____   
  |     |  
  |     |  
  |     |  
  |_____|  
```

**Large** (> 15 items):
```
    _______    
   |       |   
   |       |   
   |       |   
   |       |   
   |_______|   
```

### File Sprites

- `.lua` files ‚Üí `[L]`
- `.txt` files ‚Üí `[T]`
- `.md` files ‚Üí `[M]`
- `.js` files ‚Üí `[J]`
- `.py` files ‚Üí `[P]`
- Other files ‚Üí `[F]`

### World Generation System

1. **Initialize Grid** - Create 2D array of spaces
2. **Draw Ground** - Place = symbols at ground level + register collision rect
3. **Read Directory** - Get list of dirs and files
4. **Generate Art** - Create ASCII art for each directory
5. **Position Objects** - Place horizontally with spacing
6. **Draw Structures** - Copy art to world grid + register collision rects
7. **Place Files** - Add file sprites
8. **Draw Player** - Overlay player on top

### Collision Detection System

**Architecture**:
- Separates visual representation (grid) from collision logic (rectangles)
- Uses AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) algorithm for overlap detection
- Each structure and ground registers a collision rectangle

**World Structure**:
```lua
world = {
  width = 150,
  height = 20,
  grid = {},                 -- Visual 2D array
  collision_rects = {},      -- Array of collision rectangles
  locations = {},
  objects = {},
  ground_level = 15
}
```

**Collision Rectangle Format**:
```lua
{
  x = 5,                     -- Top-left X position
  y = 10,                    -- Top-left Y position
  width = 11,                -- Width in characters
  height = 5,                -- Height in characters
  type = "structure",        -- "structure" or "ground"
  object = location_ref      -- Optional reference
}
```

**Player Collision Logic**:
- Player treated as rectangle based on sprite dimensions (3√ó2)
- `can_move_to()` checks rectangle overlap with all collision rects
- Ground blocks only downward movement
- Structures block movement in all directions
- Uses `rects_overlap()` helper for AABB detection

**Benefits**:
- More efficient than checking grid cells (O(n) vs O(w√óh))
- Visual changes don't affect collision behavior
- Easy to add new collision types
- Player sprite characters don't cause false collisions
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

### Code Quality

- Clean module separation (ascii_art, world, renderer)
- Pure Lua with no external dependencies
- Efficient grid-based rendering
- Flexible template system
- Easy to extend with new art

### Usage Example

```vim
" Start DirQuest
:DirQuest

" Visual result:
" - Directories appear as ASCII boxes
" - Files shown as [L], [T], [F] sprites
" - Ground line separates world from sky
" - Player moves through the world with hjkl
" - Walk into a directory and press Enter to explore it
```

### Visual Layout Example

```
üìÅ /home/user/projects

  ___        _____       _______    
 |   |      |     |     |       |   
 | A |      |  B  |     |   C   |   [L] [T] [F]
 |___|      |_____|     |_______|   
=======================================
    ^
   player
```

### Next Steps

Phase 4 is complete and ready for Phase 5 implementation.

**Phase 5 Goals**:
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Coordinate-based collision detection with structures
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Prevent walking through walls
- **Remaining**: Add entrance/door system for directories
- **Remaining**: Allow entering only through designated doors
- **Remaining**: Detect when player is at entrance
- **Remaining**: Show interaction prompts

**Note**: Basic collision detection was implemented in Phase 4 using a coordinate-based system. Phase 5 will focus on refining the interaction system with entrances and prompts.

**To start Phase 5**, refer to:
- docs/SPEC.md Phase 5 section
- docs/DESIGN.md Section 2.4 (Player Controller - Movement Rules)

### Notes

- World generation happens on every render
- Directory art scales based on content size
- Files limited to 10 visible to avoid clutter
- Ground level calculated as height - 5
- Spacing of 15 characters between structures
- Text embedding centers names in boxes
- **Collision system uses coordinate rectangles, not ASCII symbol checking**
- Player sprite dimensions: 3√ó2 characters (" o " and "/|\")
- Collision detection runs in O(n) time where n = number of collision rects

### Technical Highlights

**Template System**:
- Size-based selection keeps visual variety
- Text embedding maintains readability
- Easy to add new templates

**Grid Rendering**:
- 2D array allows complex layouts
- Layer system (world ‚Üí objects ‚Üí player)
- Efficient character-by-character drawing
- Visual grid is separate from collision logic

**Collision System**:
- Coordinate-based rectangle tracking
- AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) overlap detection
- Efficient O(n) collision checks
- Type-specific collision behavior (ground vs structure)

**Object Placement**:
- Automatic horizontal layout
- Collision-free spacing
- Coordinate tracking for interaction

**File System Integration**:
- Reads actual directory sizes
- Type detection from extensions
- Graceful handling of empty dirs

### Conclusion

Phase 4 implementation is complete, tested, and documented. The plugin now features a true 2D world with ASCII art directory structures and file sprites. The visual transformation from simple player movement to a full game world is complete.

DirQuest now provides a unique, visually engaging way to explore the file system. The foundation is set for collision detection and refined interaction mechanics in Phase 5, which will make the world feel solid and the structures truly explorable.
