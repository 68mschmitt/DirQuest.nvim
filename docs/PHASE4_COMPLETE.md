   - File sprite mappings by extension (.lua, .txt, .md, .js, .py)
   - `get_file_sprite(filename)` - Returns sprite based on file type
   - `generate_ground(width)` - Creates ground line
   - Template selection heuristics (<5, 5-15, >15 items)

2. **lua/dirquest/world.lua** (143 lines)
   - `generate_world(width, height)` - Creates complete world
   - `draw_ground(world)` - Renders ground level
   - `layout_locations(world)` - Positions directories horizontally
   - `place_files(world)` - Places file sprites
   - `draw_location(world, location)` - Draws directory structure

✅ **Test 4.8**: Single directory renders  

### Automated Test Results

```
Test 4.1: ASCII art module loads... ✓ PASS
Test 4.2: World module loads... ✓ PASS
Test 4.3: Directory art templates exist... ✓ PASS
Test 4.4: Generate directory art... ✓ PASS
Test 4.5: Generate world with dimensions... ✓ PASS

✅ **Phase 1**: 5/5 tests passing  
✅ **Phase 2**: 5/5 tests passing

### Success Criteria

All Phase 4 success criteria met:

- [x] Directories rendered as ASCII art boxes
- [x] Directory names embedded in structures
- [x] Ground line renders correctly
- [x] Multiple directories positioned horizontally
- [x] Files appear as simple sprites
- [x] World can be wider than screen
- [x] Player can navigate through world

### Key Improvements Over Phase 3

- **Visual Structures** - Directories now appear as ASCII art buildings
- **Size Awareness** - Different art for different directory sizes
- **Ground System** - Visual floor that anchors the world
- **File Visibility** - Files shown as distinct sprites with types
- **Spatial Layout** - Horizontal arrangement creates exploration space
- **Object System** - Foundation for collision and interaction

### Directory Art Templates

**Small** (< 5 items):
```
  ___  
 |   | 
 |   | 
 |___| 
```

**Medium** (5-15 items):
```
   _____   
  |     |  
  |     |  
  |     |  
  |_____|  
```

**Large** (> 15 items):
```
    _______    
   |       |   
   |       |   
   |       |   
   |       |   
   |_______|   
```

### File Sprites

- `.lua` files → `[L]`
- `.txt` files → `[T]`
- `.md` files → `[M]`
- `.js` files → `[J]`
- `.py` files → `[P]`
- Other files → `[F]`

### World Generation System

1. **Initialize Grid** - Create 2D array of spaces
2. **Draw Ground** - Place = symbols at ground level
3. **Read Directory** - Get list of dirs and files
4. **Generate Art** - Create ASCII art for each directory
5. **Position Objects** - Place horizontally with spacing
6. **Draw Structures** - Copy art to world grid
7. **Place Files** - Add file sprites
8. **Draw Player** - Overlay player on top

### Code Quality

- Clean module separation (ascii_art, world, renderer)
- Pure Lua with no external dependencies
- Efficient grid-based rendering
- Flexible template system
- Easy to extend with new art

### Usage Example

```vim
" Start DirQuest
:DirQuest

" Visual result:
" - Directories appear as ASCII boxes
" - Files shown as [L], [T], [F] sprites
" - Ground line separates world from sky
" - Player moves through the world with hjkl
" - Walk into a directory and press Enter to explore it
```

### Visual Layout Example

```
📁 /home/user/projects

  ___        _____       _______    
 |   |      |     |     |       |   
 | A |      |  B  |     |   C   |   [L] [T] [F]
 |___|      |_____|     |_______|   
=======================================
    ^
   player
```

### Next Steps

Phase 4 is complete and ready for Phase 5 implementation.

**Phase 5 Goals**:
- Implement collision detection with structures
- Add entrance/door system for directories
- Prevent walking through walls
- Allow entering only through designated doors
- Detect when player is at entrance
- Show interaction prompts

**To start Phase 5**, refer to:
- docs/SPEC.md Phase 5 section
- docs/DESIGN.md Section 2.4 (Player Controller - Movement Rules)

### Notes

- World generation happens on every render
- Directory art scales based on content size
- Files limited to 10 visible to avoid clutter
- Ground level calculated as height - 5
- Spacing of 15 characters between structures
- Text embedding centers names in boxes

### Technical Highlights

**Template System**:
- Size-based selection keeps visual variety
- Text embedding maintains readability
- Easy to add new templates

**Grid Rendering**:
- 2D array allows complex layouts
- Layer system (world → objects → player)
- Efficient character-by-character drawing

**Object Placement**:
- Automatic horizontal layout
- Collision-free spacing
- Coordinate tracking for interaction

**File System Integration**:
- Reads actual directory sizes
- Type detection from extensions
- Graceful handling of empty dirs

### Conclusion

Phase 4 implementation is complete, tested, and documented. The plugin now features a true 2D world with ASCII art directory structures and file sprites. The visual transformation from simple player movement to a full game world is complete.

DirQuest now provides a unique, visually engaging way to explore the file system. The foundation is set for collision detection and refined interaction mechanics in Phase 5, which will make the world feel solid and the structures truly explorable.
