### Features Implemented

âœ… Player sprite rendering in 2D world  
âœ… HJKL movement controls  
âœ… Player position tracking  
âœ… Boundary checking (top, bottom, left, right)  
âœ… 2D world view with character grid

### Manual Testing Results

All Phase 3 tests from SPEC.md verified:

âœ… **Test 3.1**: Player sprite appears  
âœ… **Test 3.2**: Move right with `l`  
âœ… **Test 3.3**: Move left with `h`  
âœ… **Test 3.4**: Move down with `j`  
âœ… **Test 3.5**: Move up with `k`  
âœ… **Test 3.6**: Right boundary stops player  
âœ… **Test 3.7**: Left boundary stops player  
âœ… **Test 3.8**: Top boundary stops player  
âœ… **Test 3.9**: Bottom boundary stops player  
âœ… **Test 3.10**: Diagonal movement works  

### Automated Test Results

```
Test 3.1: Player module loads... âœ“ PASS
Test 3.2: Player has default sprite... âœ“ PASS
Test 3.3: Player initializes with position... âœ“ PASS
Test 3.4: Player can move... âœ“ PASS
Test 3.5: Player respects boundaries... âœ“ PASS
Test 3.6: DirQuest starts with player... âœ“ PASS
Test 3.7: Movement in all directions... âœ“ PASS
```

### All Previous Tests Still Pass

âœ… **Phase 1**: 5/5 tests passing  
âœ… **Phase 2**: 5/5 tests passing  
âœ… **Phase 3**: 7/7 tests passing  

**Total**: 17/17 tests passing

### Success Criteria

All Phase 3 success criteria met:

- [x] Player sprite renders correctly
- [x] All four directions (hjkl) work
- [x] Player cannot move outside buffer boundaries
- [x] No visual artifacts or duplicate sprites
- [x] Movement feels responsive

### Key Improvements Over Phase 2

- **2D World View** - Transitioned from list-based to spatial 2D grid
- **Player Character** - Visual representation of user in the world
- **Direct Movement** - hjkl controls for moving through space
- **Grid Rendering** - Foundation for placing objects spatially
- **Boundary System** - Proper constraints on player movement

### Rendering System

The new rendering system creates a 2D character grid:

1. Initialize grid with spaces
2. Draw header separator line
3. Draw player sprite at position
4. Convert 2D array to buffer lines
5. Render to buffer

This approach allows for:
- Easy placement of objects at coordinates
- Layer-based rendering (world, then player)
- Future collision detection
- Flexible world expansion

### Player Sprite

Default sprite (2 lines):
```
 o 
/|\
```

Can be customized via setup:
```lua
require('dirquest').setup({
  player_sprite = { " @ ", "/|\\" }
})
```

### Code Quality

- Clean module separation (player, game, renderer)
- Pure Lua with no external dependencies
- Proper boundary checking prevents errors
- State management clear and maintainable
- Movement logic simple and efficient

### Usage Example

```vim
" Start DirQuest
:DirQuest

" Move player with hjkl
h - move left
j - move down
k - move up
l - move right

" Player sprite appears and moves smoothly
" Stops at buffer edges automatically

" Press q to quit
```

### Configuration Example

```lua
require('dirquest').setup({
  -- Custom player sprite
  player_sprite = {
    " ðŸ˜Š ",
    " |  "
  }
})
```

### Next Steps

Phase 3 is complete and ready for Phase 4 implementation.

**Phase 4 Goals**:
- Generate ASCII art for directories (boxes/buildings)
- Render ground/floor line
- Position directories horizontally in world
- Display files as small sprites
- Create scrollable world wider than screen

**To start Phase 4**, refer to:
- docs/SPEC.md Phase 4 section
- docs/DESIGN.md Section 2.3 (World Generator)
- docs/DESIGN.md Section 2.6 (ASCII Art Generator)

### Notes

- Player movement is now in 2D space vs cursor-based navigation
- Foundation laid for collision detection in Phase 5
- 2D grid system ready for placing directory structures
- Header still shows current directory path for context
- Player starts at position (5, 5) by default

### Technical Highlights

**Movement System**:
- Direction-based movement (left, right, up, down)
- Returns boolean indicating if move succeeded
- Boundary checking before position update
- World dimensions passed to movement function

**Rendering Pipeline**:
1. Get window dimensions
2. Create 2D grid of spaces
3. Draw separator line
4. Get player position and sprite
5. Place player sprite on grid
6. Convert grid to lines
7. Add header and footer
8. Render to buffer

**State Management**:
- Player state separate from game state
- Player initialized on game start
- Player reset on game close
- Position persists during session

### Conclusion

Phase 3 implementation is complete, tested, and documented. The plugin now features a movable player character in a 2D world view. The rendering system is ready to accommodate directory structures and file objects in Phase 4, transforming DirQuest into a true spatial file explorer game.

The transition from list-based navigation to 2D movement is a major milestone, setting the stage for the full game experience envisioned in the design.
