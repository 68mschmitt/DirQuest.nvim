### Changed
- Updated `renderer.lua` to use world generation
- Updated `init.lua` to handle world object interaction

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- Coordinate-based collision system using AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)
- Collision rectangles tracking in world structure
- `collision_rects` array for efficient collision detection
- Rectangle overlap detection algorithm

### Improved
- Interaction UX - no longer requires exact positioning
