## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- Phase 4 implementation - Simple World Generation
- `ascii_art.lua` module with directory art templates
- `world.lua` module for world generation and layout
- Three sizes of directory ASCII art (small, medium, large)
- Ground/floor rendering with equals signs
- Horizontal layout of directory structures
- File sprites with type-based icons ([L], [T], [M], [F])
- Directory art scaled based on content size
- Text embedding in ASCII art structures
- Object detection at player position
- Interaction system for world objects
- 2D coordinate system for object placement

### Changed
- Updated `renderer.lua` to use world generation
- Updated `init.lua` to handle world object interaction
- Version bumped to 0.4.0
- Player now interacts with visual objects in world
- Enter key checks player position for nearby objects

### Technical Details
- `lua/dirquest/ascii_art.lua` - Art templates and generation
- `lua/dirquest/world.lua` - World layout and object placement
- Three directory templates based on size
- Files limited to 10 visible at once
- Objects positioned with spacing to avoid overlap

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- Coordinate-based collision system using AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)
- Collision rectangles tracking in world structure
- `collision_rects` array for efficient collision detection
- Rectangle overlap detection algorithm
- Ground collision (blocks downward movement only)
- Structure collision (blocks all directions)

### Changed
- Replaced ASCII symbol collision with coordinate-based system
- Player collision now uses rectangle overlap detection
- Visual grid separated from collision logic
- Improved performance with O(n) collision checks

### Technical Details
- `lua/dirquest/player.lua` - Added `rects_overlap()` function
- `lua/dirquest/world.lua` - Added collision rectangle registration
- Collision detection no longer checks ASCII characters
- Player sprite dimensions treated as bounding box (3Ã—2)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- Phase 5 implementation - Collision Detection and Interaction
- Entrance points for all directory structures
- `get_nearby_interactive()` function for proximity detection
- Dynamic interaction prompts in HUD
- Context-aware hints when near objects
- 2-tile detection range for interactions
- Support for both entrance and file proximity detection

### Changed
- Updated `ascii_art.lua` with entrance coordinate tracking
- Updated `world.lua` with proximity detection system
- Updated `renderer.lua` with dynamic HUD hints
- Updated `init.lua` to use proximity-based interaction
- Version bumped to 0.5.0
- Enter key now works from nearby positions (within 2 tiles)

### Improved
- Interaction UX - no longer requires exact positioning
- HUD shows contextual prompts: "<CR> to enter [name]" or "<CR> to open [name]"
- Prompts appear/disappear based on player position
- More intuitive and forgiving interaction system

### Technical Details
- Entrance positions calculated relative to structure placement
- Manhattan distance used for proximity checks
- Small template entrance: (3, 3)
- Medium template entrance: (5, 4)
- Large template entrance: (7, 5)
- Detection range: 2 tiles (configurable)
